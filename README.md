Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and click any tool from the homepage.

### Local vs Online

Most tools work perfectly in your browser. However, some tools like **YouTube Downloader** work better when run locally due to server-side limitations.

The **Video to Audio Converter** is live, but the hosted version accepts uploads up to about 4 MB. Larger files should be converted locally to avoid request-size limits.

**For full YouTube Downloader functionality:**
- See [Setup Guide](/SETUP_GUIDE.md) for step-by-step local installation
- Local setup enables unlimited downloads, full quality support, and no rate limits
- Takes only 2 minutes to set up

Project notes
- This repository contains many small tools under `app/` built with Next.js + Tailwind.
- The homepage lists Live tools only; the live registry drives featured cards, tool listings, and navigation.
